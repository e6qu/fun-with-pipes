# Selecting invariant array data once

Historical results; reproduce with the recorded revisions, not current main.
[Measurement terms](../benchmarks.md) explain the costs;
[PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md) tracks current work.

A slice may store an address into another array. The compiler now selects that
address before a loop when it proves the same F64 array survives every step.
This removes repeated representation checks; it does not reorder the sum or
fuse multiplication and addition. The actual AMD64 loops keep the address and
accumulator in registers and process four elements per loop iteration, with
ordered scalar multiply/add and no stack traffic inside that arithmetic loop.

[Four-host results](numerical-array-borrows-2026-10-15.json) use the
same [65,537-element workload, forty samples and memory modes](numerical-kernels.md). A ratio above 1 means fwp took longer in that run.

| Host | Tracing / C | Checked ARC / C | Checked ARC / Rust |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Linux AMD64 | 1.05 | 1.01 | 1.00 |
| Linux ARM64 | 2.48 | 1.00 | 0.98 |
| macOS AMD64 | 1.45 | 0.98 | 1.74 |
| macOS ARM64 | 1.66 | 1.00 | 1.01 |

Allocation profiles match the [record-move comparison](numerical-kernels.md). These samples do not isolate
a precise optimization gain: on Intel macOS ARC time fell 7.5% while both C and
Rust times rose about 33%. On Linux AMD64 tracing matrix time rose about 11%,
but the old and new matrix executables are byte-identical. The report records
those hashes and retains the slower measurements.

The separate `array-borrow` evidence suite recompiles the verified emitted C on
one host, then compares its cached read with the existing per-element selection.
It changes only the generated load expressions and verifies result hashes and
allocation profiles. Both memory modes use identical C flags, separate profiles
and forty samples with rotated process order.

That experiment compares two fwp
implementations; the table above compares fwp with C and Rust. Two complete
four-host runs are retained in the report. Below, each pair is the first and
second run's cached/per-element kernel-time ratio; below 1 means faster.

| Host | Checked ARC | Tracing |
|---|---:|---:|
| Linux AMD64 | 1.00 / 0.99 | 0.76 / 0.86 |
| Linux ARM64 | 0.96 / 0.97 | 1.00 / 1.00 |
| macOS AMD64 | 0.70 / 0.71 | 0.96 / 1.00 |
| macOS ARM64 | 0.97 / 1.02 | 1.05 / 1.01 |

The Intel macOS ARC improvement repeats. ARM macOS ARC changes direction, and
tracing is slightly slower in both runs; its generated loop removes address
selection without adding stack spills, but still reloads length around the
compiler's root-liveness fences. The experiments do not establish a universal
gain or a stable ARM macOS penalty. Outputs and allocation profiles match;
the report keeps all raw samples, including allocation-inclusive timings and
slower cases. No local timings were used.
