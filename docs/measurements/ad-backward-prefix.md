# Numeric backward prefix

Historical measurements at the revisions named below. Counts and timings are
observations of those programs, not current compiler budgets. Commands refer
to the recorded measurement revision. Read [measurement terms](../benchmarks.md)
for timing and memory boundaries; [the plan](../../PLAN.md) owns remaining work.

[This historical comparison](ad-prefix-2026-10-14.json) uses the
same reference-counted fwp program on both sides. The control scans and reserves
space for the full recorded history; the changed version stops at the last node
that can contribute to the requested result. Both record 12,291 nodes, but only
the three original inputs receive output seeds in this particular test.

Peak tape payload falls from 491,648 to 393,344 bytes: 98,304 bytes less, or about
20%. The backward pass skips 12,288 irrelevant operation nodes. Allocation
requests stay at 38. Managed-object counters are unchanged. Seven complete-process
timing samples show no consistent speedup across the four Linux/macOS hosts.
This establishes less storage and scanning for the test, not faster forward
recording or a reduction relative to another language. Workspace reuse was off.
