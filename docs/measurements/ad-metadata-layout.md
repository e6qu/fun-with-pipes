# Paired autodiff metadata allocations

Historical results; reproduce with the recorded revisions, not current main.
[Measurement terms](../benchmarks.md) explain the costs;
[PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md) tracks current work.

[The PR #141 report](ad-metadata-2026-10-15.json) compares the same
fwp programs at `24620ead` with a control using the accepted `09f1a029` tape
runtime. Everything outside that runtime section is identical. Previously each
parent array and each numeric-weight array had its own allocation. Now the two
parent arrays share one block, and the two numeric-weight arrays share another.
The contents still occupy separate, aligned regions inside their blocks.

All four Linux/macOS hosts report:

| Test | Reuse released buffers? | All tape allocation requests, control → paired | Same peak tape bytes | Bytes explicitly moved by paired growth |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Identity VJP, 4,096 inputs | Either | 2 → 2 | 32,872 | 0 |
| Mapped VJP, 4,096 inputs | Either | 30 → 16 | 163,944 | 48,384 |
| 16 mapped VJPs of 4,096 inputs | No | 465 → 241 | 163,944 | 774,144 |
| 16 mapped VJPs of 4,096 inputs | Yes | 30 → 16 | 163,944 | 48,384 |
| Replay of 4,096 operations | Either | 30 → 16 | 131,184 | 48,384 |
| Nested gradient, 256 inputs | Either | 21 → 12 | 16,632 | 5,376 |

Requests specifically for parent/weight arrays halve; total tape requests also
include other storage, so their totals do not necessarily halve. Requested bytes,
peak payload and managed-object counters are unchanged. Final measured storage
is zero, with no tracing collections.

The extra cost is moving initialized data inside the resized blocks. The table
counts those explicit moves, not copying inside the system allocator. The
control has no explicit moves but its reallocations can still copy data. The
512 KiB workspace budget and 24 numeric metadata bytes per operation are unchanged.
Actual 32-bit WebAssembly checks verify request arithmetic without attempting
gigabyte allocations. Machine-instruction inspection confirms the intended two
numeric growth calls instead of four, while ordinary stack storage remains.

That report used seven alternating process samples after one warmup for each
version/cache setting. For the 16-VJP test, the median milliseconds were:

| Host | Reuse off, control → paired | Reuse on, control → paired |
|---|---:|---:|
| Linux AMD64 | 15.828 → 16.052 | 15.369 → 15.358 |
| Linux ARM64 | 25.037 → 25.004 | 24.523 → 24.796 |
| macOS ARM64 | 26.679 → 29.444 | 30.679 → 37.041 |
| macOS Intel | 62.244 → 55.340 | 50.887 → 57.204 |

Some cases are slower. For example, macOS ARM64 with reuse takes about 21% longer
in this sample (`37.041 / 30.679 − 1`). The accepted result is fewer allocator
requests with the same payload size, not a general speedup. The report records
raw samples, CPU/compiler information, flags and verified file hashes.

The follow-up runner uses eight alternating samples, placing each version first
four times. It also includes 512 repeated derivative calculations so process
startup contributes less to the measured interval. The shorter cases remain as
controls. New results must reproduce a slowdown before assigning it to metadata
layout; changing the workload or sampling method alone is not a compiler speedup.

### Repeating the longer derivative comparison

[The four-host repeat](ad-metadata-repeat-2026-10-16.json)
uses compiler revision `48aa61dc` and the same separate-allocation tape control
from `09f1a029`. Both execute the same ARC program. The longer case performs 512
VJPs, each mapping multiplication by two over 4,096 F64 inputs with unit seeds;
it sums the resulting derivatives to `4194304.0`. A VJP computes derivatives
weighted by those seeds. This remains fwp versus fwp, with no C/Rust comparison.

After one warmup, eight samples alternate the execution order. The clock includes
process startup, input construction, derivatives and printing; compilation and
allocation profiling are separate. Both variants use `-O2 -ffp-contract=off`.
The report retains every sample, hardware/compiler details, verified source and
binary hashes, and actual ARM64/AMD64 instructions.

| Host | Paired/control time, reuse off | Paired/control time, reuse on |
|---|---:|---:|
| Linux AMD64 | 0.985 | 0.986 |
| Linux ARM64 | 0.987 | 0.985 |
| macOS ARM64 | 1.086 | 1.058 |
| macOS Intel | 0.960 | 1.020 |

A ratio above one is slower: ARM macOS takes 8.6% more time without reuse and
5.8% more with reuse in this run. The previous short-workload slowdown is not a
portable speed conclusion; the longer test still warrants investigation.

For all four hosts, paired storage reduces tape allocation requests from 14,849
to 7,681 without reuse and from 30 to 16 with reuse. Peak tape payload remains
163,944 bytes. Both variants make 25,184,777 managed allocation requests for
805,720,218 requested bytes and 10,492,416 retains; peak charged managed storage
is 840,888 bytes. These separate peaks need not occur simultaneously. Final tape
and charged managed storage are zero, with no tracing collections. These counts
exclude allocator metadata and OS reservations. Avoiding language-level temporary
values remains substantial work beyond reducing tape allocations.

In the retained ARM macOS binary, the append function has 198 instructions
versus 253 in the control; both backward functions have 374. Linux AMD64 counts
are 239 versus 296 for append and 399 for both backward functions. The report
also counts stack-address instructions without labeling them all as register
spills. Smaller append code has not established a dependable speed improvement.
The following controlled layout experiment leaves production behavior unchanged.

### Interleaving recorded operation pairs

[The layout trial](ad-layout-2026-10-16.json) changes only generated
experimental C. Each operation has two parent indices and two derivative weights.
Current storage keeps each side in its own region of a shared block; the trial
places each operation's pair together. It keeps the two allocation blocks, their
sizes and arithmetic order, and avoids moving second regions when capacity grows.
Production runtime storage is unchanged.

The same six derivative workloads run under ARC with reuse off/on, using the
same flags, eight alternating samples and separate profiling as above. Output,
allocation counts, requested bytes, peak/final memory and zero collections agree.
For 512 mapped VJPs, explicit growth copies fall from 24,772,608 bytes to zero
without reuse, or from 48,384 to zero with reuse. This excludes copying performed
internally by the system allocator. Managed allocation costs remain unchanged.

| Host | Interleaved/current time, reuse off | Interleaved/current time, reuse on |
|---|---:|---:|
| Linux AMD64 | 1.012 | 1.012 |
| Linux ARM64 | 1.001 | 1.010 |
| macOS ARM64 | 0.930 | 0.938 |
| macOS Intel | 1.005 | 0.986 |

The sustained case is 7.0%/6.2% faster on ARM macOS in this run, with mixed results
elsewhere. Short cases also vary: ARM macOS's single mapped VJP without reuse is
31.1% slower. These process timings include startup and output; absolute times
from separate runner executions should not be compared as if hardware load were
identical. Repeat promising results before selecting a new runtime layout.

Native instructions also show a tradeoff. On ARM macOS, append shrinks from 198
to 182 instructions but backward grows from 374 to 384. On Linux AMD64 the counts
are 239 to 207 and 399 to 412. The report retains both function disassemblies.
These counts alone explain neither the speed differences nor their cause. The
[allocation-site investigation](ad-allocation-sites.md#where-derivative-allocations-occur) attributes
the much larger managed allocation count to actual calls instead of assuming
tape layout is the dominant cost.
